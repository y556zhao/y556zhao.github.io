# Intro

I am currently a PhD student at the [Matter Lab](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/) of University of Toronto and the [Vector Institute](https://vectorinstitute.ai/), supervised by [Prof. Al√°n Aspuru-Guzik](https://www.matter.toronto.edu/basic-content-page/about-alan), [Prof. Florian Shkurti](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~florian/) and [Prof. Animesh Garg](https://animesh.garg.tech/). I recently graduated from Univeristy of Waterloo Mechatronics Engineering where I completed 6 internships in industry and academia.

I am interested in building robots that leverage multimodal inputs, including vision, language, and tactile sensing that allow robots to quickly adapt to unstructured environments, efficiently learn to solve complex tasks, and closely interact with humans. Specifically, my interest lies in applying these advancements to self-driving laboratories for accelerating materials discovery. Checkout my projects for more details.
